              <p> For this Group Project we used Illustrator and decided to do a Nursing Technology Institue. Axolotls are often linked to medical research because of their unique ability to regenerate body parts, including limbs and tissues. This regenerative power is of interest in nursing and medicine, as studying how axolotls heal can provide insights into wound recovery and tissue repair in humans. Understanding their biology could help advance treatments for injuries and improve patient care in the future.</p>

              <p>A hot air balloon ride brings pure joy and happiness as it gently lifts into the sky. The peaceful rise, with colorful balloons against the blue sky, creates a sense of freedom and wonder. Floating above the world, everything below seems far away, leaving you with a light, carefree feeling. It's a joyful escape, full of calm and adventure.</p>

              <p> I chose 3 different pictures, A mountain, an ocean and a desert picture, to create this Glitch image. I added all pictures together and used Notepad++ to do the glitch.</p>

              <p>For this Project I used the Bandsaw to cut each individual piece of Cardboard and used the stacking method for a cardboard chair, layers of cardboard are cut and stacked to build a strong, stable structure. I aligned the pieces and compressed them with wood glue to evenly distribute weight, creating a durable chair. This technique highlights both functionality and sustainable design.</p>

              <div class="text">2 Point Perspective Drawing</div>
              <p> This two-point perspective drawing of a house involves using two vanishing points on the horizon line to create a realistic 3D effect. The house's edges recede toward these points, making the structure appear more dimensional. Vertical lines remain parallel, while horizontal lines converge at the vanishing points. This method allows for accurate depiction of depth and proportion, giving the house a lifelike appearance from a corner view.</p>

              <div class="text">Still Life Drawing</div>
              <p>A still life drawing involves depicting inanimate objects, often arranged artistically. Common subjects include fruits, flowers, vases, and everyday items, allowing artists to explore form, texture, and light. I used common things that are in everyone's kitchen for my drawing. The focus is on composition and the play of light and shadow, enhancing the visual appeal. This type of drawing helps develop skills in observation, proportion, and shading, enabling artists to capture the beauty of ordinary objects in a unique way.</p>

              <div class="text">1 Point Perspective</div>
              <p>A one-point perspective drawing of a living room involves a single vanishing point located on the horizon line. All parallel lines, such as the edges of walls, furniture, and windows, converge at this point, creating a sense of depth. The front of the furniture, like a sofa or coffee table, is drawn facing the viewer, while the sides recede toward the vanishing point. This technique helps illustrate the spatial relationships within the room, making it appear three-dimensional and inviting.</p>

              <div class="text">Plaster Project</div>
              <p>In my plaster project, I created a human figure without a face, crossing its arms. To me it looks like a human trying to protect something important and it could be a keyholder or jewlery. The lack of facial features emphasizes anonymity and emotional depth, inviting viewers to interpret the figure's feelings and thoughts. Overall, the piece explores themes of self-protection and the complexities of human expression.</p>
