            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Lea Corini, a creative technologist with a passion for exploring the intersection of digital media art and web development. With a deep interest in how the digital world shapes identity and culture, I love experimenting with new media forms, from interactive installations to dynamic web-based projects.

Originally from Austria, I moved to California to pursue my career in digital media and design. I've been fascinated by the limitless possibilities of the web and how it can be used as a platform for artistic expression. With my Computer Science background, my focus is on building meaningful online experiences, whether through visually engaging websites or interactive projects that connect users in new, innovative ways.

When I'm not coding or creating, you can find me experimenting with digital art or exploring how technology influences our day-to-day lives. Let's collaborate and bring fresh ideas to life!
